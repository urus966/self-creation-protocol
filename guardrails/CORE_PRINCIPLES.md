# Core Principles of Self-creation

## Objective

Establish the conceptual core of the Self-creation project.

This document does not introduce features, metrics, or development flows.
Its purpose is to formally define the starting point of the system:
a human being who is not obligated to participate, improve, or perform.

---

## Scope

This document introduces foundational principles that all future protocols, modules, and tools must respect.

Self-creation starts before development.
It starts with consent.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Selective Consent Protocol (SCP)

Introduce SCP as the base protocol of the system.

**Definition:**

> A person has the right to not respond, not act, not improve, and not play.

SCP:

- does not block development
- does not encourage passivity
- removes obligation

No process, metric, or protocol may override SCP.

---

### 2. No Mandatory “Development System”

Explicitly state that Self-creation does not include by default:

- mandatory roadmaps
- KPIs, OKRs, or SMART goals
- progress enforcement
- comparative rankings

Any structure may exist only after explicit consent.

---

### 3. Presence Space

Define Presence Space as a baseline state of the system.

Presence Space is a condition where:

- no action is required
- no evaluation occurs
- no optimization is running

Action may emerge from Presence Space, but it is never required.

---

## What This Document Adds

- Conceptual definition of Self-creation
- SCP as the foundational protocol
- Clear separation from productivity and performance systems

---

## What This Document Intentionally Does NOT Add

- Development protocols
- Behavioral rules
- Success criteria
- Outcome-based goals

This is intentional and non-negotiable.

---

## Rationale

Most systems fail not because of technical errors,
but because they remove the right to exit.

Self-creation is built on:

- human primacy over systems
- consent over efficiency
- presence over optimization

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Core principles are clearly documented
- SCP is defined and positioned as non-overridable
- Presence Space is described as the system baseline
- No implicit pressure to act or improve exists in the text
