# Presence Space

## Definition

Presence Space is the baseline state of the Self-creation system in which:

- no task is mandatory
- no evaluation is performed
- no optimization is running
- no progress is expected

The system remains valid and complete while in Presence Space.

## Key Properties

### 1. Baseline State

Presence Space is the default system state.
All other states (action, development, execution) are optional overlays, not upgrades.

### 2. Non-Transitional

Presence Space is not:

- a step before action
- a recovery phase
- a precondition for productivity

A system may remain in Presence Space indefinitely without error.

### 3. Consent-Gated Exit

Transition out of Presence Space:

- requires explicit consent
- cannot be triggered by metrics, deadlines, or external pressure
- cannot be inferred implicitly

No protocol may force an exit.

### 4. SCP Compatibility

Presence Space is fully aligned with the Selective Consent Protocol (SCP).

If SCP grants the right not to act,
Presence Space is the environment where that right is structurally supported.
