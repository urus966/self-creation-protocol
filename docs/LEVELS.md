# Levels

## Level A (protocol layer)
- Contains rules, constraints, and operational logic.
- Can reference Level B.
- Can be validated, tested, and applied.

## Level B (foundation layer)
- Represents the base state (presence space).
- Is not a protocol.
- Cannot be validated, tested, or applied.

## Scope
- PRESENCE_SPACE.md is the only Level B document.
- All other documents are Level A.
- See SYSTEM_MAP.md for document relationships.

## What levels are NOT
- Levels are not hierarchy or priority.
- Levels do not introduce new concepts or layers beyond A and B.
